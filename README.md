# Yash

Greetings! I'm [Yash](https://github.com/yash212020) ðŸ‘‹. My venture into the realm of technology commenced with my enrollment at [SRMIST](https://www.srmist.edu.in/), igniting a profound curiosity within me. Since then, I've delved into various languages and frameworks including C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Dart, ReactJS, and React Native. As an eager enthusiast, I'm driven by the ceaseless evolution of technology and the opportunities it presents for continual learning and exploration.

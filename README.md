Hey there, I'm [Yash](https://github.com/is-shaun) ðŸ‘‹. My journey into the world of technology began when I enrolled at [SRMIST](https://www.srmist.edu.in/). Since then, I've immersed myself in languages and frameworks like C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Dart, ReactJS, and React Native. I'm just another enthusiast eager to explore the ever-evolving landscape of technology and learning.

I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of Artificial Generative Intelligence (AGI) and its synergies with human evolution. I find joy in solving problems and constantly expanding my knowledge. With a minimalistic approach, I enjoy the challenge of debugging and contributing to innovations that shape our future. Let's embark on this journey of discovery together! ðŸŒŸ
